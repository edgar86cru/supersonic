        // get media position
        my_media.getCurrentPosition(
            // success callback
            function (position) {
                if (position > -1) {
                    console.log((position) + " sec");
                }
            },
            // error callback
            function (e) {
                console.log("Error getting pos=" + e);
            }
        );
