Returns the duration of an audio file in seconds. If the duration is unknown, it returns a value of -1.


    media.getDuration();

## Quick Example

    // Audio player
    //
    var my_media = new Media(src, onSuccess, onError);

    // Get duration
    var counter = 0;
    var timerDur = setInterval(function() {
        counter = counter + 100;
        if (counter > 2000) {
            clearInterval(timerDur);
        }
        var dur = my_media.getDuration();
        if (dur > 0) {
            clearInterval(timerDur);
            document.getElementById('audio_duration').innerHTML = (dur) + " sec";
        }
    }, 100);
