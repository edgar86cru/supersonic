# media.release

Releases the underlying operating system's audio resources.
This is particularly important for Android, since there are a finite amount of
OpenCore instances for media playback. Applications should call the `release`
function for any `Media` resource that is no longer needed.

    media.release();


## Quick Example

    // Audio player
    //
    var my_media = new Media(src, onSuccess, onError);

    my_media.play();
    my_media.stop();
    my_media.release();
