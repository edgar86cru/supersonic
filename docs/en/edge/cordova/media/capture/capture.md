# Capture

> Provides access to the device's audio, image, and video capture capabilities.

__WARNING__: Collection and use of images, video, or
audio from the device's camera or microphone raises important privacy
issues.  Your app's privacy policy should discuss how the app uses
such sensors and whether the data recorded is shared with any other
parties.  In addition, if the app's use of the camera or microphone is
not apparent in the user interface, you should provide a just-in-time
notice before the app accesses the camera or microphone (if the
device operating system doesn't do so already). That notice should
provide the same information noted above, as well as obtaining the
user's permission (e.g., by presenting choices for __OK__ and __No
Thanks__).  Note that some app marketplaces may require your app to
provide just-in-time notice and obtain permission from the user prior
to accessing the camera or microphone.  For more information, please
see the Privacy Guide.
