# abort

Aborts an in-progress transfer. The onerror callback is passed a FileTransferError object which has an error code of FileTransferError.ABORT_ERR.

## Example

    // !! Assumes variable fileURL contains a valid URL to a text file on the device,
    //    for example, cdvfile://localhost/persistent/path/to/file.txt

    var win = function(r) {
        console.log("Should not be called.");
    }

    var fail = function(error) {
        // error.code == FileTransferError.ABORT_ERR
        alert("An error has occurred: Code = " + error.code);
        console.log("upload error source " + error.source);
        console.log("upload error target " + error.target);
    }

    var options = new FileUploadOptions();
    options.fileKey="file";
    options.fileName="myphoto.jpg";
    options.mimeType="image/jpeg";

    var ft = new FileTransfer();
    ft.upload(fileURL, encodeURI("http://some.server.com/upload.php"), win, fail, options);
    ft.abort();
