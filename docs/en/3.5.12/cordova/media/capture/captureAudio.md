# capture.captureAudio

> Start the audio recorder application and return information about captured audio clip files.

    navigator.device.capture.captureAudio(
        CaptureCB captureSuccess, CaptureErrorCB captureError,  [CaptureAudioOptions options]
    );

## Description

Starts an asynchronous operation to capture audio recordings using the
device's default audio recording application.  The operation allows
the device user to capture multiple recordings in a single session.

The capture operation ends when either the user exits the audio
recording application, or the maximum number of recordings specified
by `CaptureAudioOptions.limit` is reached.  If no `limit` parameter
value is specified, it defaults to one (1), and the capture operation
terminates after the user records a single audio clip.

When the capture operation finishes, the `CaptureCallback` executes
with an array of `MediaFile` objects describing each captured audio
clip file.  If the user terminates the operation before an audio clip
is captured, the `CaptureErrorCallback` executes with a `CaptureError`
object, featuring the `CaptureError.CAPTURE_NO_MEDIA_FILES` error
code.

## Supported Platforms

- Android
- iOS

## Example

    // capture callback
    var captureSuccess = function(mediaFiles) {
        var i, path, len;
        for (i = 0, len = mediaFiles.length; i < len; i += 1) {
            path = mediaFiles[i].fullPath;
            // do something interesting with the file
        }
    };

    // capture error callback
    var captureError = function(error) {
        navigator.notification.alert('Error code: ' + error.code, null, 'Capture Error');
    };

    // start audio capture
    navigator.device.capture.captureAudio(captureSuccess, captureError, {limit:2});

## iOS Quirks

- iOS does not have a default audio recording application, so a simple user interface is provided.
