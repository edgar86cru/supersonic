Controls
========

This section documents all of the controls that can be styled with Freestyle.

Each page shows all of the CSS information about a control: the selectors that reference it, the properties it supports, its children, and its pseudo-classes.

Since many controls contain important subelements, this guide lists each element's __child elements__, along with their properties. Pay close attention to these, as many common styling changes actually occur on the children of controls.

Values are referenced by type or string values. Alternate selections for a single value type are separated by commas. Types appear as links to the corresponding information in the `Values` section. String values are the literal text as they appear in this document.
