# download

__Parameters__:

- __source__: URL of the server to download the file, as encoded by `encodeURI()`.

- __target__: Filesystem url representing the file on the device. For backwards compatibility, this can also be the full path of the file on the device. (See [Backwards Compatibility Notes] below)

- __successCallback__: A callback that is passed  a `FileEntry` object. _(Function)_

- __errorCallback__: A callback that executes if an error occurs when retrieving the `Metadata`. Invoked with a `FileTransferError` object. _(Function)_

- __trustAllHosts__: Optional parameter, defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, it accepts all security certificates. This is useful because Android rejects self-signed security certificates. Not recommended for production use. Supported on Android and iOS. _(boolean)_

- __options__: Optional parameters, currently only supports headers (such as Authorization (Basic Authentication), etc).

## Example

    // !! Assumes variable fileURL contains a valid URL to a path on the device,
    //    for example, cdvfile://localhost/persistent/path/to/downloads/

    var fileTransfer = new FileTransfer();
    var uri = encodeURI("http://some.server.com/download.php");

    fileTransfer.download(
        uri,
        fileURL,
        function(entry) {
            console.log("download complete: " + entry.fullPath);
        },
        function(error) {
            console.log("download error source " + error.source);
            console.log("download error target " + error.target);
            console.log("upload error code" + error.code);
        },
        false,
        {
            headers: {
                "Authorization": "Basic dGVzdHVzZXJuYW1lOnRlc3RwYXNzd29yZA=="
            }
        }
    );
